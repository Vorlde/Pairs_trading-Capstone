# Pairs_trading-Capstone

Overview
This project aims to enhance the pairs trading using deep learning techniques to predict cointegration of asset pairs in future periods. Pairs trading is a market-neutral strategy that profits from the price deviations between two historically co-integrated assets. By introducing a deep-LSTM architecture, our solution seeks to improve the accuracy of selecting pairs that are likely to remain cointegrated
